# Background
<br>
The CEO of a retail company (ABC Inc.) is planning to branch into the Canadian market.
They mainly specialize in kids’ apparel, educational toys and books. However, they would also like their store to have an entertainment section that would cater to organizing parties, and other kids’ related events. The age groups they want to focus on are 0 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, and 10 to 14 years old.
They are also thinking of opening a separate service for 15 to 19 year olds that would cater to offering them mobile cell phone options. However they are not sure if they should make that service available as an online option or sell that in store as well?
They would like to enter the market with an initial opening of 10 store locations across Canada.

# Business Objective
Help ABC Inc. analyze the Census Canada data to understand what locations (Provinces & Cities i.e. Census Metropolitan Areas)
the company should focus on to open their first 10 stores that would tailor to the needs of 0 to 14 year olds? As well as assess the potential of opening an 
instore or online mobile phone service just for the 15 to 19 year olds. <br> 

<ul>
  <li>Is there a split in gender by each of the age groups? Should the top 10 stores all stock the same amount of apparel, toys and books for each gender and age groups, as well as provide the same kind of entertainment services?</li>
   <li>Is there potential for growth with all these age groups i.e. are there some age groups dropping in numbers while others are showing an increase? </li>
   <li>What is the average income after tax of the families and their sources of income? </li>
   <li>Based on the 10 cities where the stores are going to be located, what top 3 languages should they advertise in? </li>
   <li>Regarding the mobile phone service option for the 15 to 19 year olds, would your team recommend an instore or an online service experience? </li>
</ul>
