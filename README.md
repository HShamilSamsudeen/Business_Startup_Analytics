# Background
<br>
The CEO of a retail company (ABC Inc.) is planning to branch into the Canadian market.
They mainly specialize in kids’ apparel, educational toys and books. However, they would also like their store to have an entertainment section that would cater to organizing parties, and other kids’ related events. The age groups they want to focus on are 0 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, and 10 to 14 years old.
They are also thinking of opening a separate service for 15 to 19 year olds that would cater to offering them mobile cell phone options. However they are not sure if they should make that service available as an online option or sell that in store as well?
They would like to enter the market with an initial opening of 10 store locations across Canada.

# Business Objective<br>
Help ABC Inc. analyze the Census Canada data to understand what locations (Provinces & Cities i.e. Census Metropolitan Areas)
the company should focus on to open their first 10 stores that would tailor to the needs of 0 to 14 year olds? As well as assess the potential of opening an 
instore or online mobile phone service just for the 15 to 19 year olds.
